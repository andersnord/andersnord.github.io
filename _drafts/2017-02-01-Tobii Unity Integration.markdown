The last three months at Tobii I was integrating our eyetracking features into published games.

bla bla bla




Plantin Time is a puzzle game based around how tropism works and how plant genes are affected by different types of soil. You use this knowledge when choosing which plant to grow. You goal is to reach the golden tiles. 

It was created for [Legends Of Learning][LoL] to be used as an educational game in the American school system.

The development time was 2 weeks and I created it together with [Zack Wood][ZackWebPage] who made the art.

The game incorporates sound and music as well.

The first teacher that evaluated the game wrote:
> Great game and Great music! Great critical thinking game that demonstrates plant genes and tropisms."

and the second teacher wrote:

> This is a simple, but addicting game! Students will love this simulation which makes them really think about what their plant needs to get to the "goal!""
