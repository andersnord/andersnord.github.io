I recently got accepted to [Stugan 2017][Stugan2017], an accelerator program for talented game developers with my game [The Lost Light of Sisu][TLLOS]. It will run from the 26th of june - 12th of august.

I am super excited about this and cannot not wait to be a part of Stugan and meet all the talanted game developers.
