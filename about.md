My name is Anders Nord and I am currently doing my master thesis at Frostbite - Electronic Arts. I am otherwise attending the Master of Science (M.Sc.), Media Technology and Engineering program at Link√∂ping University in Sweden. 

My big passions in life are programming, creating music, paint, or when i can, combine them all.
