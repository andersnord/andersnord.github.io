My name is Anders Nord and I am a contract software developer and indie game developer based in Stockholm.
While I work on my own game, I also do contract work regarding software and game development.

Before starting my own business I used to work full time as a software developer in the interactions team at the R&D part of **[Tobii Tech][TobiiTech]**.

When not hanging out with friends or family my passions in life are programming, making games and creating music.
