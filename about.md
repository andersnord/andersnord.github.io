My name is Anders Nord and I am currently working as a software developer in the interactions team at the R&D part of **[Tobii Tech][TobiiTech]** in Stockholm. 

My main profession is software developer but that is not solely how I would entitle myself. User Experience is constantly present during my daily work when I am creating new and unexplored interactions through eye tracking. Because of this it is necessary at all times to consider the end user experience from many angles to be able to create something that feels natural, easy to grasp and like a must-have.

When not hanging out with friends or family my big passions in life are programming, making games and creating music.
